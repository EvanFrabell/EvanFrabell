### Evan Frabell

I'll paste some tutorial links here in the future.  Fair warning - I typically stop creating tutorials early in the process and streamline to the information I need to complete my current project.  I attempt to come back later and fill them in with examples pertaining to the language and job at hand.

:panda_face: <a href="https://github.com/EvanFrabell/my-pandas-guide" target="_blank">Python Pandas Guide</a> - This is pretty much everything you'll need to for data manipulation with Pandas.
